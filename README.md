# Hi, I'm Desmond Fowler

I’m a **Systems Analyst** with 4+ years in IT support, business analysis, and system optimization. I love **automation**, **infrastructure**, and solving real-world problems with tech, whether it’s streamlining processes or building something cool from scratch. Outside work, I tinker with my home lab and dig into open-source projects.
