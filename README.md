# Hi, I'm Desmond Fowler

I'm a **Systems Analyst** with over 4 years of experience in IT support, business analysis, and system analysis. I’m passionate about **automation**, **infrastructure**, and using technology to solve real-world problems. Optimizing workflows, building scalable systems, or exploring new cloud tools are some of the things I enjoy tinkering with. I love finding ways to make things work smarter.

Outside of work, I’m either tinkering with my home lab, experimenting with cloud platforms, or automating everyday tasks. I’m a big believer in open-source collaboration and lifelong learning.
